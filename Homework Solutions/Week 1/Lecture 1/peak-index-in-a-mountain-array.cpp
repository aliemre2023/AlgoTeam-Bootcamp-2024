/*
The array is divided into two regions: ascending and descending.
The question is finding the peak point where the transition between these two regions occurs.


Linear search could be done, but this costs O(N). Let's see if a binary search might work as a better solution.


Our array is actually like this:
***ASC*** | PEAK | ***DESC***


The main goal is to reach PEAK. For all iterations, if I am in the DESC field I have to go left and vice versa.
So when will I reach the result?


Let's try an example
You update the left and right pointers for all iterations.
***ASC*** | PEAK | ***DESC***
|                           |
|                   |
   |               |
       |           |
       |       |		
       |    |
           ||


The pointers meet in the PEAK if you construct your binary search correctly(exit loop if left < right).
(Give a numerical example and try)


When I exit from binary search loop, both pointers point PEAK. I could return one of them.


Time complexity: O(logN)
Space complexity: O(1)

        // KINDLY REMINDER: If you declare a variable and 
        // do not initialize it(assign it a value),

        // memory block it points to, which is random for us.
        // 
        // Initializing a variable with an initial value
        // is good practice because unexpected random values
        // are dangerous.

                // the next iteration. This may change anything in
                // your implementation, but it may cause various problems 
                // such as infinite loops for different questions.
